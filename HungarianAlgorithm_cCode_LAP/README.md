### C++ implementation of the Hungarian algorithm by Roy Jonker "A Shortest Augmenting Path Algorithm for Dense and Sparse Linear Assignment Problems (1987)"

#### Modified to use the output of my Instantaneous Flow Tracker ("Online track initiation and propagation depend critically on computing the global vector fleld of particle flow using a new optimal-flow minimum-cost graph algorithm") https://researchgate.net/publication/224625167_Reliable_tracking_of_large_scale_dense_antiparallel_particle_motion_for_fluorescence_live_cell_imaging to initialize the Kalman filter and compiled as an executable by Ge Yang for the publication "Reliable Tracking of Large Scale Dense Antiparallel Particle Motion for Fluorescence Live Cell Imaging (2005)"
